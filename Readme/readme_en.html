	</li>
	<li><h3>Making changes</h3>
		<p>If you intend to make changes to any of the defines contained in the files of this package, save the changed files to the relevant template folder of your install. It is not recommended to overwrite the existing core files as it will make future upgrades much more difficult. For information about how to use the override system please <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/wiki/index.php/The_override_system_simplified" target="_blank"><b>consult this tutorial</b></a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Assign currency to this language pack</h3>
		<p>If you want your customers to automatically switch to the Dutch default currency Euro when they select the German language at your store front, then go to Admin => Configuration => My Store and set 'Switch To Default Language Currency' to true. This will automatically switch to the language's currency when it is changed</p>
